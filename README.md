ðŸ§  What is a Hirst Painting?
Damien Hirst's dot paintings typically feature a grid of evenly spaced, colorful dots, often created with vibrant, contrasting colors.

ðŸŽ¨ Customize to Make it Unique
To make your Hirst-style painting feel "worth a million":

Use a custom color palette (extract from a real Hirst painting using an image color extractor).

Try gold accents, metallic look, or different dot sizes.

Add interactive elements, animations, or a signature at the end using Turtle.
